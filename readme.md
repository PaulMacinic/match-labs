# Week4 exercise2

On the Logout page that you created in the previous exercise, you should now also clear the information that lives in the Context.

When the Logout page mounts, call a function that sets the `user Context data` equal to `false`.

The main trick of the exercise is to figure out how can you call a function from the Context inside the Logout page.
Hint: Use the knowledge you gained in lab 3 :)
