# Week5 - Exercise II

For this exercise we would like to give new users the possibility to choose if thwy want to assign a candidate or a company role to their account.

When clicking on a specific role, you should make a call to the assignCandidate or assignCompany endpoint. Before being able to call that endpoint, you will have to make sure that you have first registered the user.

I attached a preview of the final result in the /lab-resources folder, assignRole.png
